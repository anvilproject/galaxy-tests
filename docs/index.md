# Automated Tests for Galaxy on Kubernetes Stacks
## Galaxy on GKE deployed via GalaxyKubeMan (AnVIL)
### Deployment Testing
Twice a day, [GalaxyKubeMan (GKM)](https://github.com/galaxyproject/galaxykubeman-helm) is deployed on GKE, mimicking an AnVIL deployment. The purpose of these tests is to provide reasonable confidence that Galaxy is launchable on the AnVIL everyday.

Below is a plot summarizing successful deployments and GKM install times.

### Tool Testing
After each successful deployment, automated tool tests are also run against the instance. These serve as an end-to-end-like test for Galaxy, providing confidence that Galaxy is not only launchable but functional. These tests cycle on a weekly basis through the entire suite of tools installed by default on AnVIL, providing reasonable confidence that the tools encountered by most users remain functional, and automating the detection and reporting of tools breaking.

**Error Date: 2022-07-04-16-15-58**

The error message you've encountered is a SyntaxError, indicating that there is an issue with the syntax of the code being executed. In this case, the problem lies with the usage of the print statement within the list comprehension in the script. The print statement is being used in a way that is not supported in Python 3, which is likely the version of Python being used in your Galaxy environment.

To explain the error in more detail, the problematic part of the code is:

```python
for line in ("\t".join(sorted(line.strip().split("\t"))) for line in open("/galaxy/server/database/objects/6/7/7/dataset_67785f63-c443-46f3-810d-0ed8882551f2.dat")): print line

**Error Date: 2022-07-08-04-38-47**

This error message indicates several issues with the VCFtools command execution. Let's break down the error step by step:

1. **Invalid File Format**: The error "No header or meta information. Invalid file: sorted.vcf" suggests that the input VCF file `sorted.vcf` may have issues with its format. A VCF (Variant Call Format) file should contain specific header lines that describe the metadata in the file and the format of the variant data. If the header is missing or improperly formatted, VCFtools cannot process the file.

2. **Missing Dependency**: The error "vcf-sort: command not found" indicates that the `vcf-sort` command, which is likely used internally by VCFtools for sorting VCF files, is not found in the system's PATH. This could be due to the tool not being installed or not being accessible to the Galaxy environment where the tool is running.
