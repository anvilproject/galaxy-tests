13:38:38)\n    Welcome to Unicycler, an assembly pipeline for bacterial genomes. Since you\nprovided both short and long reads, Unicycler will perform a hybrid assembly.\nIt will first use SPAdes to make a short-read assembly graph, and then it will\nuse various methods to scaffold that graph with the long reads.\n    For more information, please see https://github.com/rrwick/Unicycler\n\nCommand: /usr/local/bin/unicycler -t 8 -o ./ --verbosity 3 -1 fq1.fastq.gz -2 fq2.fastq.gz -l lr.fasta --mode normal --min_fasta_length 100 --linear_seqs 0 --min_kmer_frac 0.2 --max_kmer_frac 0.95 --kmer_count 10 --depth_filter 0.25 --start_gene_id 90.0 --start_gene_cov 95.0 --min_component_size 1000 --min_dead_end_size 1000 --scores 3,-6,-5,-2 --keep 0\n\nUnicycler version: v0.5.1\nUsing 8 threads\n\nThe output directory already exists and files may be reused or overwritten:\n  /galaxy/server/database/jobs_directory/000/156/working\n\nBridging mode: normal\n  using default normal bridge quality cutoff: 10.00\n\nDependencies:\n  Program       Version   Status   Path                      \n  spades.py     4.0.0     good     /usr/local/bin/spades.py  \n  racon         1.5.0     good     /usr/local/bin/racon      \n  makeblastdb   2.16.0+   good     /usr/local/bin/makeblastdb\n  tblastn       2.16.0+   good     /usr/local/bin/tblastn    \n\n\nChoosing k-mer range for assembly (2025-05-27 13:38:38)\n    Unicycler chooses a k-mer range for SPAdes based on the length of the input\nreads. It uses a wide range of many k-mer sizes to maximise the chance of\nfinding an ideal assembly.\n\nSPAdes maximum k-mer: 127\nMedian read length: 251\nK-mer range: 27, 47, 63, 77, 89, 99, 107, 115, 121, 127\n\n\nSPAdes assemblies (2025-05-27 13:38:38)\n    Unicycler now uses SPAdes to assemble the short reads. It scores the\nassembly graph for each k-mer using the number of contigs (fewer is better) and\nthe number of dead ends (fewer is better). The score function is 1/(c*(d+2)),\nwhere c is the contig count and d is the dead end count.\n\nspades.py -o /galaxy/server/database/jobs_directory/000/156/working/spades_assembly -k 27 --threads 8 --gfa11 --isolate -1 /galaxy/server/database/jobs_directory/000/156/working/fq1.fastq.gz -2 /galaxy/server/database/jobs_directory/000/156/working/fq2.fastq.gz -m 1024\n== Warning ==  output dir is not empty!

underlying\nsequence. Single-copy contigs (those with a multiplicity of one, occurring only\nonce in the underlying sequence) are particularly useful.\n    Multiplicity determination begins by identifying contigs which are clearly\nsingle-copy because they are of low depth and do not have more than one link\nper side.\n\nMedian depth of 10 longest contigs: 1.00\n\n\nInitial single copy segments:\n    1\n\n    Unicycler now uses a greedy algorithm to propagate multiplicity through the\ngraph. For example, if two single-copy contigs merge together, the resulting\ncontig will get a multiplicity of two. When no more propagation is possible,\nadditional single-copy contigs are added and the process is repeated. This\nallows for multiplicity to be correctly assigned to the chromosome (at the\nmedian depth) but also for plasmids (which may be higher or lower in depth).\n\n          MERGING MULTIPLICITY        \n        SPLITTING MULTIPLICITY        \n       FINDING NEW SINGLE-COPY        \n          MERGING MULTIPLICITY        \n        SPLITTING MULTIPLICITY        \nREMOVING PROPAGATION TOLERANCE        \n          MERGING MULTIPLICITY        \n        SPLITTING MULTIPLICITY        \n\n\nCleaning graph (2025-05-27 13:40:55)\n    Unicycler now performs various cleaning procedures on the graph to remove\noverlaps and simplify the graph structure. The end result is a graph ready for\nbridging.\n\nGrouping graph edges based on overlap removal\n\r0 / 2 (0.0%)\r1 / 2 (50.0%)\r2 / 2 (100.0%)\n\nRemoving graph overlaps\n\n             Bases     Bases\n           trimmed   trimmed\n Segment      from      from\n  number     start       end\n       1        13        14\nGraph overlaps removed\n\n    Unicycler now selects a set of anchor contigs from the single-copy contigs.\nThese are the contigs which will be connected via bridges to form the final\nassembly.\n\n\n1 anchor segments (5,386 bp) out of 1 total segments (5,386 bp)\n\nAnchor segments:\n    1\n\n\nCreating SPAdes contig bridges (2025-05-27 13:40:55)\n    SPAdes uses paired-end information to perform repeat resolution (RR) and\nproduce contigs from the assembly graph. SPAdes saves the graph paths\ncorresponding to these contigs in the contigs.paths file. When one of these\npaths contains two or more anchor contigs, Unicycler can create a bridge from\nthe path.\n\nNo SPAdes contig bridges\n\n\nCreating loop unrolling bridges (2025-05-27 13:40:55)\n    When a SPAdes contig path connects an anchor contig with the middle contig\nof a simple loop, Unicycler concludes that the sequences are contiguous (i.e.\nthe loop is not a separate piece of DNA). It then uses the read depth of the\nmiddle and repeat contigs to guess the number of times to traverse the loop and\nmakes a bridge.\n\nNo loop unrolling bridges made\nnone found\n\n\nLoading reads (2025-05-27 13:40:55)\n\r0 / 1 (0.0%)\r1 / 1 (100.0%) - 5,386 bp\r1 / 1 (100.0%) - 5,386 bp\n\n\nAssembling contigs and long reads with miniasm (2025-05-27 13:40:55)\n    Unicycler uses miniasm to construct a string graph assembly using both the\nshort read contigs and the long reads. It will then use the resulting string\ngraph to produce bridges between contigs. This method requires decent coverage\nof long reads and therefore may not be fruitful if long reads are sparse.\nHowever, it does not rely on the short read assembly graph having good\nconnectivity and is able to bridge an assembly graph even when it contains many\ndead ends.\n    Unicycler uses two types of \"reads\" as assembly input: anchor contigs from\nthe short-read assembly and actual long reads which overlap two or more of\nthese contigs. It then assembles them with miniasm.\n\nAligning long reads to graph using minimap\nSaving /galaxy/server/database/jobs_directory/000/156/working/miniasm_assembly/all_segments.fasta\n1\t5386\t3\t5158\t+\t1\t5386\t227\t5382\t5155\t5155\t255\tcm:i:1149\n1\t5386\t5163\t5383\t+\t1\t5386\t1\t221\t220\t220\t255\tcm:i:47\nNumber of minimap alignments: 1\n\nSaving to /galaxy/server/database/jobs_directory/000/156/working/miniasm_assembly/01_assembly_reads.fastq:\n  0 short-read contigs\n  1 long reads\n\nFinding overlaps with minimap... failed\nAssembling reads with miniasm... empty result\n\n\nCreating simple long read bridges (2025-05-27 13:40:55)\n    Unicycler uses long read alignments (from minimap) to resolve simple repeat\nstructures in the graph.

This usually represents\na simple 2-copy repeat, and there are two possible options for its resolution:\n(A->C->D and B->C->E) or (A->C->E and B->C->D). Each read which spans such a\njunction gets to \"vote\" for option 1, option 2 or neither. Unicycler creates a\nbridge at each junction for the most voted for option.\n\nNo suitable two-way junctions present\n\n    Simple loops are parts of the graph where two contigs (A and B) are\nconnected via a repeat (C) which loops back to itself (via D). It is possible\nto traverse the loop zero times (A->C->B), one time (A->C->D->C->B), two times\n(A->C->D->C->D->C->B), etc. Long reads which span the loop inform which is the\ncorrect number of times through. In this step, such reads are found and each is\naligned against alternative loop counts. A reads casts its \"vote\" for the loop\ncount it agrees best with, and Unicycler creates a bridge using the most voted\nfor count.\n\nNo suitable simple loops present\n\n\nDetermining low score threshold (2025-05-27 13:40:55)\n    Before conducting semi-global alignment of the long reads to the assembly\ngraph, Unicycler must determine a minimum alignment score threshold such that\nnonsense alignments are excluded. To choose a threshold automatically, it\nexamines alignments between random sequences and selects a score a few standard\ndeviations above the mean.\n\nAutomatically choosing a threshold using random alignment scores.\n\nRandom alignment mean score: 61.66\n         standard deviation:  1.31\n        Low score threshold: 61.66 + (7 x 1.31) = 70.86\n\n\nAligning reads with minimap (2025-05-27 13:40:55)\n1\t5386\t5\t5161\t+\t1\t5386\t229\t5385\t5156\t5156\t255\tcm:i:959\n1\t5386\t5168\t5384\t+\t1\t5386\t6\t222\t216\t216\t255\tcm:i:39\n\nDone! 1 out of 1 reads aligned\n\n\nAligning reads (2025-05-27 13:40:55)\n1/1: 1 (5386 bp)\nminimap alignments:\n    5,5161,+,1,229,5385\n    5168,5384,+,1,6,222\nReference ranges:\n    1+: 0 - 5386\nRange: 1: 0 - 5386\n    common 10-mers: 5464\n    line 1: 215 points, score=213.009259 (good)\n    line 2: 5153 points, score=5151.000388 (good)\nAll Seqan alignments (time to align = 0.055 s):\n  Ref name  Ref start  Ref end  Read start  Read end  Strand  Raw score  Scaled score  Identity\n         1          0      224        5162      5386       +        672        100.00   100.00%\n         1        224     5386           0      5162       +      15486        100.00   100.00%\nFinal alignments:\n  Ref name  Ref start  Ref end  Read start  Read end  Strand  Raw score  Scaled score  Identity\n         1        224     5386           0      5162       +      15486        100.00   100.00%\n         1          0      224        5162      5386       +        672        100.00   100.00%\n\n\nRead alignment summary (2025-05-27 13:40:55)\nTotal read count:            1\nFully aligned reads:         1\nPartially aligned reads:     0\nUnaligned reads:             0\nTotal bases aligned:     5,386 bp\nMean alignment identity:   100.0%\n\nDeleting /galaxy/server/database/jobs_directory/000/156/working/read_alignment/\n\nSetting the minimum scaled score to the 5.0th percentile of full read alignments: 0.00\n\n\nBuilding long read bridges (2025-05-27 13:40:55)\n    Unicycler uses the long read alignments to produce bridges between anchor\nsegments.

underlying\nsequence. Single-copy contigs (those with a multiplicity of one, occurring only\nonce in the underlying sequence) are particularly useful.\n    Multiplicity determination begins by identifying contigs which are clearly\nsingle-copy because they are of low depth and do not have more than one link\nper side.\n\nMedian depth of 10 longest contigs: 1.00\n\n\nInitial single copy segments:\n    1\n\n    Unicycler now uses a greedy algorithm to propagate multiplicity through the\ngraph. For example, if two single-copy contigs merge together, the resulting\ncontig will get a multiplicity of two. When no more propagation is possible,\nadditional single-copy contigs are added and the process is repeated. This\nallows for multiplicity to be correctly assigned to the chromosome (at the\nmedian depth) but also for plasmids (which may be higher or lower in depth).\n\n          MERGING MULTIPLICITY        \n        SPLITTING MULTIPLICITY        \n       FINDING NEW SINGLE-COPY        \n          MERGING MULTIPLICITY        \n        SPLITTING MULTIPLICITY        \nREMOVING PROPAGATION TOLERANCE        \n          MERGING MULTIPLICITY        \n        SPLITTING MULTIPLICITY        \n\n\nCleaning graph (2025-05-27 13:40:55)\n    Unicycler now performs various cleaning procedures on the graph to remove\noverlaps and simplify the graph structure. The end result is a graph ready for\nbridging.\n\nGrouping graph edges based on overlap removal\n\r0 / 2 (0.0%)\r1 / 2 (50.0%)\r2 / 2 (100.0%)\n\nRemoving graph overlaps\n\n             Bases     Bases\n           trimmed   trimmed\n Segment      from      from\n  number     start       end\n       1        13        14\nGraph overlaps removed\n\n    Unicycler now selects a set of anchor contigs from the single-copy contigs.\nThese are the contigs which will be connected via bridges to form the final\nassembly.\n\n\n1 anchor segments (5,386 bp) out of 1 total segments (5,386 bp)\n\nAnchor segments:\n    1\n\n\nCreating SPAdes contig bridges (2025-05-27 13:40:55)\n    SPAdes uses paired-end information to perform repeat resolution (RR) and\nproduce contigs from the assembly graph. SPAdes saves the graph paths\ncorresponding to these contigs in the contigs.paths file. When one of these\npaths contains two or more anchor contigs, Unicycler can create a bridge from\nthe path.\n\nNo SPAdes contig bridges\n\n\nCreating loop unrolling bridges (2025-05-27 13:40:55)\n    When a SPAdes contig path connects an anchor contig with the middle contig\nof a simple loop, Unicycler concludes that the sequences are contiguous (i.e.\nthe loop is not a separate piece of DNA). It then uses the read depth of the\nmiddle and repeat contigs to guess the number of times to traverse the loop and\nmakes a bridge.\n\nNo loop unrolling bridges made\nnone found\n\n\nLoading reads (2025-05-27 13:40:55)\n\r0 / 1 (0.0%)\r1 / 1 (100.0%) - 5,386 bp\r1 / 1 (100.0%) - 5,386 bp\n\n\nAssembling contigs and long reads with miniasm (2025-05-27 13:40:55)\n    Unicycler uses miniasm to construct a string graph assembly using both the\nshort read contigs and the long reads. It will then use the resulting string\ngraph to produce bridges between contigs. This method requires decent coverage\nof long reads and therefore may not be fruitful if long reads are sparse.\nHowever, it does not rely on the short read assembly graph having good\nconnectivity and is able to bridge an assembly graph even when it contains many\ndead ends.\n    Unicycler uses two types of \"reads\" as assembly input: anchor contigs from\nthe short-read assembly and actual long reads which overlap two or more of\nthese contigs. It then assembles them with miniasm.\n\nAligning long reads to graph using minimap\nSaving /galaxy/server/database/jobs_directory/000/156/working/miniasm_assembly/all_segments.fasta\n1\t5386\t3\t5158\t+\t1\t5386\t227\t5382\t5155\t5155\t255\tcm:i:1149\n1\t5386\t5163\t5383\t+\t1\t5386\t1\t221\t220\t220\t255\tcm:i:47\nNumber of minimap alignments: 1\n\nSaving to /galaxy/server/database/jobs_directory/000/156/working/miniasm_assembly/01_assembly_reads.fastq:\n  0 short-read contigs\n  1 long reads\n\nFinding overlaps with minimap... failed\nAssembling reads with miniasm... empty result\n\n\nCreating simple long read bridges (2025-05-27 13:40:55)\n    Unicycler uses long read alignments (from minimap) to resolve simple repeat\nstructures in the graph.

This usually represents\na simple 2-copy repeat, and there are two possible options for its resolution:\n(A->C->D and B->C->E) or (A->C->E and B->C->D). Each read which spans such a\njunction gets to \"vote\" for option 1, option 2 or neither. Unicycler creates a\nbridge at each junction for the most voted for option.\n\nNo suitable two-way junctions present\n\n    Simple loops are parts of the graph where two contigs (A and B) are\nconnected via a repeat (C) which loops back to itself (via D). It is possible\nto traverse the loop zero times (A->C->B), one time (A->C->D->C->B), two times\n(A->C->D->C->D->C->B), etc. Long reads which span the loop inform which is the\ncorrect number of times through. In this step, such reads are found and each is\naligned against alternative loop counts. A reads casts its \"vote\" for the loop\ncount it agrees best with, and Unicycler creates a bridge using the most voted\nfor count.\n\nNo suitable simple loops present\n\n\nDetermining low score threshold (2025-05-27 13:40:55)\n    Before conducting semi-global alignment of the long reads to the assembly\ngraph, Unicycler must determine a minimum alignment score threshold such that\nnonsense alignments are excluded. To choose a threshold automatically, it\nexamines alignments between random sequences and selects a score a few standard\ndeviations above the mean.\n\nAutomatically choosing a threshold using random alignment scores.\n\nRandom alignment mean score: 61.66\n         standard deviation:  1.31\n        Low score threshold: 61.66 + (7 x 1.31) = 70.86\n\n\nAligning reads with minimap (2025-05-27 13:40:55)\n1\t5386\t5\t5161\t+\t1\t5386\t229\t5385\t5156\t5156\t255\tcm:i:959\n1\t5386\t5168\t5384\t+\t1\t5386\t6\t222\t216\t216\t255\tcm:i:39\n\nDone! 1 out of 1 reads aligned\n\n\nAligning reads (2025-05-27 13:40:55)\n1/1: 1 (5386 bp)\nminimap alignments:\n    5,5161,+,1,229,5385\n    5168,5384,+,1,6,222\nReference ranges:\n    1+: 0 - 5386\nRange: 1: 0 - 5386\n    common 10-mers: 5464\n    line 1: 215 points, score=213.009259 (good)\n    line 2: 5153 points, score=5151.000388 (good)\nAll Seqan alignments (time to align = 0.055 s):\n  Ref name  Ref start  Ref end  Read start  Read end  Strand  Raw score  Scaled score  Identity\n         1          0      224        5162      5386       +        672        100.00   100.00%\n         1        224     5386           0      5162       +      15486        100.00   100.00%\nFinal alignments:\n  Ref name  Ref start  Ref end  Read start  Read end  Strand  Raw score  Scaled score  Identity\n         1        224     5386           0      5162       +      15486        100.00   100.00%\n         1          0      224        5162      5386       +        672        100.00   100.00%\n\n\nRead alignment summary (2025-05-27 13:40:55)\nTotal read count:            1\nFully aligned reads:         1\nPartially aligned reads:     0\nUnaligned reads:             0\nTotal bases aligned:     5,386 bp\nMean alignment identity:   100.0%\n\nDeleting /galaxy/server/database/jobs_directory/000/156/working/read_alignment/\n\nSetting the minimum scaled score to the 5.0th percentile of full read alignments: 0.00\n\n\nBuilding long read bridges (2025-05-27 13:40:55)\n    Unicycler uses the long read alignments to produce bridges between anchor\nsegments.

Since you\nprovided only short reads, Unicycler will essentially function as a SPAdes-\noptimiser. It will try many k-mer sizes, choose the best based on contig length\nand graph connectivity, and scaffold the graph using SPAdes repeat resolution.\n    For more information, please see https://github.com/rrwick/Unicycler\n\nCommand: /usr/local/bin/unicycler -t 8 -o ./ --verbosity 3 -1 fq1.fastq -2 fq2.fastq --mode normal --min_fasta_length 100 --linear_seqs 0 --min_kmer_frac 0.2 --max_kmer_frac 0.95 --kmer_count 10 --depth_filter 0.25 --start_gene_id 90.0 --start_gene_cov 95.0 --min_component_size 1000 --min_dead_end_size 1000 --scores 3,-6,-5,-2 --keep 1\n\nUnicycler version: v0.5.1\nUsing 8 threads\n\nThe output directory already exists and files may be reused or overwritten:\n  /galaxy/server/database/jobs_directory/000/167/working\n\nBridging mode: normal\n  using default normal bridge quality cutoff: 10.00\n\nDependencies:\n  Program       Version   Status     Path                      \n  spades.py     4.0.0     good       /usr/local/bin/spades.py  \n  racon                   not used                             \n  makeblastdb   2.16.0+   good       /usr/local/bin/makeblastdb\n  tblastn       2.16.0+   good       /usr/local/bin/tblastn    \n\n\nChoosing k-mer range for assembly (2025-05-27 13:42:51)\n    Unicycler chooses a k-mer range for SPAdes based on the length of the input\nreads. It uses a wide range of many k-mer sizes to maximise the chance of\nfinding an ideal assembly.\n\nSPAdes maximum k-mer: 127\nMedian read length: 251\nK-mer range: 27, 47, 63, 77, 89, 99, 107, 115, 121, 127\n\n\nSPAdes assemblies (2025-05-27 13:42:51)\n    Unicycler now uses SPAdes to assemble the short reads. It scores the\nassembly graph for each k-mer using the number of contigs (fewer is better) and\nthe number of dead ends (fewer is better). The score function is 1/(c*(d+2)),\nwhere c is the contig count and d is the dead end count.\n\nspades.py -o /galaxy/server/database/jobs_directory/000/167/working/spades_assembly -k 27 --threads 8 --gfa11 --isolate -1 /galaxy/server/database/jobs_directory/000/167/working/fq1.fastq -2 /galaxy/server/database/jobs_directory/000/167/working/fq2.fastq -m 1024\n== Warning ==  output dir is not empty!

underlying\nsequence. Single-copy contigs (those with a multiplicity of one, occurring only\nonce in the underlying sequence) are particularly useful.\n    Multiplicity determination begins by identifying contigs which are clearly\nsingle-copy because they are of low depth and do not have more than one link\nper side.\n\nMedian depth of 10 longest contigs: 1.00\n\n\nInitial single copy segments:\n    1\n\n    Unicycler now uses a greedy algorithm to propagate multiplicity through the\ngraph. For example, if two single-copy contigs merge together, the resulting\ncontig will get a multiplicity of two. When no more propagation is possible,\nadditional single-copy contigs are added and the process is repeated. This\nallows for multiplicity to be correctly assigned to the chromosome (at the\nmedian depth) but also for plasmids (which may be higher or lower in depth).\n\n          MERGING MULTIPLICITY        \n        SPLITTING MULTIPLICITY        \n       FINDING NEW SINGLE-COPY        \n          MERGING MULTIPLICITY        \n        SPLITTING MULTIPLICITY        \nREMOVING PROPAGATION TOLERANCE        \n          MERGING MULTIPLICITY        \n        SPLITTING MULTIPLICITY        \n\nSaving /galaxy/server/database/jobs_directory/000/167/working/002_depth_filter.gfa\n\n\nCleaning graph (2025-05-27 13:45:11)\n    Unicycler now performs various cleaning procedures on the graph to remove\noverlaps and simplify the graph structure.

It then uses the read depth of the\nmiddle and repeat contigs to guess the number of times to traverse the loop and\nmakes a bridge.\n\nNo loop unrolling bridges made\nnone found\n\n\nApplying bridges (2025-05-27 13:45:11)\n    Unicycler now applies to the graph in decreasing order of quality.

/galaxy/server/database/jobs_directory/000/167/working/spades_assembly/\n\n\nDetermining graph multiplicity (2025-05-27 13:45:11)\n    Multiplicity is the number of times a sequence occurs in the underlying\nsequence. Single-copy contigs (those with a multiplicity of one, occurring only\nonce in the underlying sequence) are particularly useful.\n    Multiplicity determination begins by identifying contigs which are clearly\nsingle-copy because they are of low depth and do not have more than one link\nper side.\n\nMedian depth of 10 longest contigs: 1.00\n\n\nInitial single copy segments:\n    1\n\n    Unicycler now uses a greedy algorithm to propagate multiplicity through the\ngraph. For example, if two single-copy contigs merge together, the resulting\ncontig will get a multiplicity of two. When no more propagation is possible,\nadditional single-copy contigs are added and the process is repeated. This\nallows for multiplicity to be correctly assigned to the chromosome (at the\nmedian depth) but also for plasmids (which may be higher or lower in depth).\n\n          MERGING MULTIPLICITY        \n        SPLITTING MULTIPLICITY        \n       FINDING NEW SINGLE-COPY        \n          MERGING MULTIPLICITY        \n        SPLITTING MULTIPLICITY        \nREMOVING PROPAGATION TOLERANCE        \n          MERGING MULTIPLICITY        \n        SPLITTING MULTIPLICITY        \n\nSaving /galaxy/server/database/jobs_directory/000/167/working/002_depth_filter.gfa\n\n\nCleaning graph (2025-05-27 13:45:11)\n    Unicycler now performs various cleaning procedures on the graph to remove\noverlaps and simplify the graph structure. The end result is a graph ready for\nbridging.\n\nGrouping graph edges based on overlap removal\n\r0 / 2 (0.0%)\r1 / 2 (50.0%)\r2 / 2 (100.0%)\n\nRemoving graph overlaps\n\n             Bases     Bases\n           trimmed   trimmed\n Segment      from      from\n  number     start       end\n       1        13        14\nGraph overlaps removed\n\nSaving /galaxy/server/database/jobs_directory/000/167/working/003_overlaps_removed.gfa\n\n    Unicycler now selects a set of anchor contigs from the single-copy contigs.\nThese are the contigs which will be connected via bridges to form the final\nassembly.\n\n\n1 anchor segments (5,386 bp) out of 1 total segments (5,386 bp)\n\nAnchor segments:\n    1\n\n\nCreating SPAdes contig bridges (2025-05-27 13:45:11)\n    SPAdes uses paired-end information to perform repeat resolution (RR) and\nproduce contigs from the assembly graph. SPAdes saves the graph paths\ncorresponding to these contigs in the contigs.paths file. When one of these\npaths contains two or more anchor contigs, Unicycler can create a bridge from\nthe path.\n\nNo SPAdes contig bridges\n\n\nCreating loop unrolling bridges (2025-05-27 13:45:11)\n    When a SPAdes contig path connects an anchor contig with the middle contig\nof a simple loop, Unicycler concludes that the sequences are contiguous (i.e.\nthe loop is not a separate piece of DNA). It then uses the read depth of the\nmiddle and repeat contigs to guess the number of times to traverse the loop and\nmakes a bridge.\n\nNo loop unrolling bridges made\nnone found\n\n\nApplying bridges (2025-05-27 13:45:11)\n    Unicycler now applies to the graph in decreasing order of quality.

Since you\nprovided both short and long reads, Unicycler will perform a hybrid assembly.\nIt will first use SPAdes to make a short-read assembly graph, and then it will\nuse various methods to scaffold that graph with the long reads.\n    For more information, please see https://github.com/rrwick/Unicycler\n\nCommand: /usr/local/bin/unicycler -t 8 -o ./ --verbosity 3 -1 fq1.fastq -2 fq2.fastq -l lr.fasta --mode normal --min_fasta_length 100 --linear_seqs 0 --min_kmer_frac 0.2 --max_kmer_frac 0.95 --kmer_count 10 --depth_filter 0.25 --start_gene_id 90.0 --start_gene_cov 95.0 --min_component_size 1000 --min_dead_end_size 1000 --scores 3,-6,-5,-2 --keep 2\n\nUnicycler version: v0.5.1\nUsing 8 threads\n\nThe output directory already exists and files may be reused or overwritten:\n  /galaxy/server/database/jobs_directory/000/171/working\n\nBridging mode: normal\n  using default normal bridge quality cutoff: 10.00\n\nDependencies:\n  Program       Version   Status   Path                      \n  spades.py     4.0.0     good     /usr/local/bin/spades.py  \n  racon         1.5.0     good     /usr/local/bin/racon      \n  makeblastdb   2.16.0+   good     /usr/local/bin/makeblastdb\n  tblastn       2.16.0+   good     /usr/local/bin/tblastn    \n\n\nChoosing k-mer range for assembly (2025-05-27 13:46:02)\n    Unicycler chooses a k-mer range for SPAdes based on the length of the input\nreads. It uses a wide range of many k-mer sizes to maximise the chance of\nfinding an ideal assembly.\n\nSPAdes maximum k-mer: 127\nMedian read length: 251\nK-mer range: 27, 47, 63, 77, 89, 99, 107, 115, 121, 127\n\n\nSPAdes assemblies (2025-05-27 13:46:02)\n    Unicycler now uses SPAdes to assemble the short reads. It scores the\nassembly graph for each k-mer using the number of contigs (fewer is better) and\nthe number of dead ends (fewer is better). The score function is 1/(c*(d+2)),\nwhere c is the contig count and d is the dead end count.\n\nspades.py -o /galaxy/server/database/jobs_directory/000/171/working/spades_assembly -k 27 --threads 8 --gfa11 --isolate -1 /galaxy/server/database/jobs_directory/000/171/working/fq1.fastq -2 /galaxy/server/database/jobs_directory/000/171/working/fq2.fastq -m 1024\n== Warning ==  output dir is not empty!

underlying\nsequence. Single-copy contigs (those with a multiplicity of one, occurring only\nonce in the underlying sequence) are particularly useful.\n    Multiplicity determination begins by identifying contigs which are clearly\nsingle-copy because they are of low depth and do not have more than one link\nper side.\n\nMedian depth of 10 longest contigs: 1.00\n\n\nInitial single copy segments:\n    1\n\n    Unicycler now uses a greedy algorithm to propagate multiplicity through the\ngraph. For example, if two single-copy contigs merge together, the resulting\ncontig will get a multiplicity of two. When no more propagation is possible,\nadditional single-copy contigs are added and the process is repeated. This\nallows for multiplicity to be correctly assigned to the chromosome (at the\nmedian depth) but also for plasmids (which may be higher or lower in depth).\n\n          MERGING MULTIPLICITY        \n        SPLITTING MULTIPLICITY        \n       FINDING NEW SINGLE-COPY        \n          MERGING MULTIPLICITY        \n        SPLITTING MULTIPLICITY        \nREMOVING PROPAGATION TOLERANCE        \n          MERGING MULTIPLICITY        \n        SPLITTING MULTIPLICITY        \n\nSaving /galaxy/server/database/jobs_directory/000/171/working/002_depth_filter.gfa\n\n\nCleaning graph (2025-05-27 13:48:19)\n    Unicycler now performs various cleaning procedures on the graph to remove\noverlaps and simplify the graph structure.

It will then use the resulting string\ngraph to produce bridges between contigs. This method requires decent coverage\nof long reads and therefore may not be fruitful if long reads are sparse.\nHowever, it does not rely on the short read assembly graph having good\nconnectivity and is able to bridge an assembly graph even when it contains many\ndead ends.\n    Unicycler uses two types of \"reads\" as assembly input: anchor contigs from\nthe short-read assembly and actual long reads which overlap two or more of\nthese contigs.

This usually represents\na simple 2-copy repeat, and there are two possible options for its resolution:\n(A->C->D and B->C->E) or (A->C->E and B->C->D). Each read which spans such a\njunction gets to \"vote\" for option 1, option 2 or neither. Unicycler creates a\nbridge at each junction for the most voted for option.\n\nNo suitable two-way junctions present\n\n    Simple loops are parts of the graph where two contigs (A and B) are\nconnected via a repeat (C) which loops back to itself (via D). It is possible\nto traverse the loop zero times (A->C->B), one time (A->C->D->C->B), two times\n(A->C->D->C->D->C->B), etc. Long reads which span the loop inform which is the\ncorrect number of times through. In this step, such reads are found and each is\naligned against alternative loop counts. A reads casts its \"vote\" for the loop\ncount it agrees best with, and Unicycler creates a bridge using the most voted\nfor count.\n\nNo suitable simple loops present\n\n\nDetermining low score threshold (2025-05-27 13:48:19)\n    Before conducting semi-global alignment of the long reads to the assembly\ngraph, Unicycler must determine a minimum alignment score threshold such that\nnonsense alignments are excluded.

It uses a wide range of many k-mer sizes to maximise the chance of\nfinding an ideal assembly.\n\nSPAdes maximum k-mer: 127\nMedian read length: 251\nK-mer range: 27, 47, 63, 77, 89, 99, 107, 115, 121, 127\n\n\nSPAdes assemblies (2025-05-27 13:46:02)\n    Unicycler now uses SPAdes to assemble the short reads. It scores the\nassembly graph for each k-mer using the number of contigs (fewer is better) and\nthe number of dead ends (fewer is better). The score function is 1/(c*(d+2)),\nwhere c is the contig count and d is the dead end count.\n\nspades.py -o /galaxy/server/database/jobs_directory/000/171/working/spades_assembly -k 27 --threads 8 --gfa11 --isolate -1 /galaxy/server/database/jobs_directory/000/171/working/fq1.fastq -2 /galaxy/server/database/jobs_directory/000/171/working/fq2.fastq -m 1024\n== Warning ==  output dir is not empty!

underlying\nsequence. Single-copy contigs (those with a multiplicity of one, occurring only\nonce in the underlying sequence) are particularly useful.\n    Multiplicity determination begins by identifying contigs which are clearly\nsingle-copy because they are of low depth and do not have more than one link\nper side.\n\nMedian depth of 10 longest contigs: 1.00\n\n\nInitial single copy segments:\n    1\n\n    Unicycler now uses a greedy algorithm to propagate multiplicity through the\ngraph. For example, if two single-copy contigs merge together, the resulting\ncontig will get a multiplicity of two. When no more propagation is possible,\nadditional single-copy contigs are added and the process is repeated. This\nallows for multiplicity to be correctly assigned to the chromosome (at the\nmedian depth) but also for plasmids (which may be higher or lower in depth).\n\n          MERGING MULTIPLICITY        \n        SPLITTING MULTIPLICITY        \n       FINDING NEW SINGLE-COPY        \n          MERGING MULTIPLICITY        \n        SPLITTING MULTIPLICITY        \nREMOVING PROPAGATION TOLERANCE        \n          MERGING MULTIPLICITY        \n        SPLITTING MULTIPLICITY        \n\nSaving /galaxy/server/database/jobs_directory/000/171/working/002_depth_filter.gfa\n\n\nCleaning graph (2025-05-27 13:48:19)\n    Unicycler now performs various cleaning procedures on the graph to remove\noverlaps and simplify the graph structure.

SPAdes saves the graph paths\ncorresponding to these contigs in the contigs.paths file. When one of these\npaths contains two or more anchor contigs, Unicycler can create a bridge from\nthe path.\n\nNo SPAdes contig bridges\n\n\nCreating loop unrolling bridges (2025-05-27 13:48:19)\n    When a SPAdes contig path connects an anchor contig with the middle contig\nof a simple loop, Unicycler concludes that the sequences are contiguous (i.e.\nthe loop is not a separate piece of DNA).

It will then use the resulting string\ngraph to produce bridges between contigs. This method requires decent coverage\nof long reads and therefore may not be fruitful if long reads are sparse.\nHowever, it does not rely on the short read assembly graph having good\nconnectivity and is able to bridge an assembly graph even when it contains many\ndead ends.\n    Unicycler uses two types of \"reads\" as assembly input: anchor contigs from\nthe short-read assembly and actual long reads which overlap two or more of\nthese contigs. It then assembles them with miniasm.\n\nAligning long reads to graph using minimap\nSaving /galaxy/server/database/jobs_directory/000/171/working/miniasm_assembly/all_segments.fasta\n1\t5386\t3\t5158\t+\t1\t5386\t227\t5382\t5155\t5155\t255\tcm:i:1149\n1\t5386\t5163\t5383\t+\t1\t5386\t1\t221\t220\t220\t255\tcm:i:47\nNumber of minimap alignments: 1\n\nSaving to /galaxy/server/database/jobs_directory/000/171/working/miniasm_assembly/01_assembly_reads.fastq:\n  0 short-read contigs\n  1 long reads\n\nFinding overlaps with minimap... failed\nAssembling reads with miniasm... empty result\n\n\nCreating simple long read bridges (2025-05-27 13:48:19)\n    Unicycler uses long read alignments (from minimap) to resolve simple repeat\nstructures in the graph.

This usually represents\na simple 2-copy repeat, and there are two possible options for its resolution:\n(A->C->D and B->C->E) or (A->C->E and B->C->D). Each read which spans such a\njunction gets to \"vote\" for option 1, option 2 or neither. Unicycler creates a\nbridge at each junction for the most voted for option.\n\nNo suitable two-way junctions present\n\n    Simple loops are parts of the graph where two contigs (A and B) are\nconnected via a repeat (C) which loops back to itself (via D). It is possible\nto traverse the loop zero times (A->C->B), one time (A->C->D->C->B), two times\n(A->C->D->C->D->C->B), etc. Long reads which span the loop inform which is the\ncorrect number of times through. In this step, such reads are found and each is\naligned against alternative loop counts. A reads casts its \"vote\" for the loop\ncount it agrees best with, and Unicycler creates a bridge using the most voted\nfor count.\n\nNo suitable simple loops present\n\n\nDetermining low score threshold (2025-05-27 13:48:19)\n    Before conducting semi-global alignment of the long reads to the assembly\ngraph, Unicycler must determine a minimum alignment score threshold such that\nnonsense alignments are excluded. To choose a threshold automatically, it\nexamines alignments between random sequences and selects a score a few standard\ndeviations above the mean.\n\nAutomatically choosing a threshold using random alignment scores.\n\nRandom alignment mean score: 61.66\n         standard deviation:  1.31\n        Low score threshold: 61.66 + (7 x 1.31) = 70.86\n\n\nAligning reads with minimap (2025-05-27 13:48:19)\n1\t5386\t5\t5161\t+\t1\t5386\t229\t5385\t5156\t5156\t255\tcm:i:959\n1\t5386\t5168\t5384\t+\t1\t5386\t6\t222\t216\t216\t255\tcm:i:39\n\nDone! 1 out of 1 reads aligned\n\n\nAligning reads (2025-05-27 13:48:19)\n1/1: 1 (5386 bp)\nminimap alignments:\n    5,5161,+,1,229,5385\n    5168,5384,+,1,6,222\nReference ranges:\n    1+: 0 - 5386\nRange: 1: 0 - 5386\n    common 10-mers: 5464\n    line 1: 215 points, score=213.009259 (good)\n    line 2: 5153 points, score=5151.000388 (good)\nAll Seqan alignments (time to align = 0.057 s):\n  Ref name  Ref start  Ref end  Read start  Read end  Strand  Raw score  Scaled score  Identity\n         1          0      224        5162      5386       +        672        100.00   100.00%\n         1        224     5386           0      5162       +      15486        100.00   100.00%\nFinal alignments:\n  Ref name  Ref start  Ref end  Read start  Read end  Strand  Raw score  Scaled score  Identity\n         1        224     5386           0      5162       +      15486        100.00   100.00%\n         1          0      224        5162      5386       +        672        100.00   100.00%\n\n\nRead alignment summary (2025-05-27 13:48:19)\nTotal read count:            1\nFully aligned reads:         1\nPartially aligned reads:     0\nUnaligned reads:             0\nTotal bases aligned:     5,386 bp\nMean alignment identity:   100.0%\n\nSetting the minimum scaled score to the 5.0th percentile of full read alignments: 0.00\n\n\nBuilding long read bridges (2025-05-27 13:48:19)\n    Unicycler uses the long read alignments to produce bridges between anchor\nsegments.

underlying\nsequence. Single-copy contigs (those with a multiplicity of one, occurring only\nonce in the underlying sequence) are particularly useful.\n    Multiplicity determination begins by identifying contigs which are clearly\nsingle-copy because they are of low depth and do not have more than one link\nper side.\n\nMedian depth of 10 longest contigs: 1.00\n\n\nInitial single copy segments:\n    1\n\n    Unicycler now uses a greedy algorithm to propagate multiplicity through the\ngraph. For example, if two single-copy contigs merge together, the resulting\ncontig will get a multiplicity of two. When no more propagation is possible,\nadditional single-copy contigs are added and the process is repeated. This\nallows for multiplicity to be correctly assigned to the chromosome (at the\nmedian depth) but also for plasmids (which may be higher or lower in depth).\n\n          MERGING MULTIPLICITY        \n        SPLITTING MULTIPLICITY        \n       FINDING NEW SINGLE-COPY        \n          MERGING MULTIPLICITY        \n        SPLITTING MULTIPLICITY        \nREMOVING PROPAGATION TOLERANCE        \n          MERGING MULTIPLICITY        \n        SPLITTING MULTIPLICITY        \n\n\nCleaning graph (2025-05-27 13:51:27)\n    Unicycler now performs various cleaning procedures on the graph to remove\noverlaps and simplify the graph structure.

SPAdes saves the graph paths\ncorresponding to these contigs in the contigs.paths file. When one of these\npaths contains two or more anchor contigs, Unicycler can create a bridge from\nthe path.\n\nNo SPAdes contig bridges\n\n\nCreating loop unrolling bridges (2025-05-27 13:51:27)\n    When a SPAdes contig path connects an anchor contig with the middle contig\nof a simple loop, Unicycler concludes that the sequences are contiguous (i.e.\nthe loop is not a separate piece of DNA). It then uses the read depth of the\nmiddle and repeat contigs to guess the number of times to traverse the loop and\nmakes a bridge.\n\nNo loop unrolling bridges made\nnone found\n\n\nLoading reads (2025-05-27 13:51:27)\n\r0 / 1 (0.0%)\r1 / 1 (100.0%) - 5,386 bp\r1 / 1 (100.0%) - 5,386 bp\n\n\nAssembling contigs and long reads with miniasm (2025-05-27 13:51:27)\n    Unicycler uses miniasm to construct a string graph assembly using both the\nshort read contigs and the long reads. It will then use the resulting string\ngraph to produce bridges between contigs. This method requires decent coverage\nof long reads and therefore may not be fruitful if long reads are sparse.\nHowever, it does not rely on the short read assembly graph having good\nconnectivity and is able to bridge an assembly graph even when it contains many\ndead ends.\n    Unicycler uses two types of \"reads\" as assembly input: anchor contigs from\nthe short-read assembly and actual long reads which overlap two or more of\nthese contigs. It then assembles them with miniasm.\n\nAligning long reads to graph using minimap\nSaving /galaxy/server/database/jobs_directory/000/175/working/miniasm_assembly/all_segments.fasta\n1\t5386\t3\t5158\t+\t1\t5386\t227\t5382\t5155\t5155\t255\tcm:i:1149\n1\t5386\t5163\t5383\t+\t1\t5386\t1\t221\t220\t220\t255\tcm:i:47\nNumber of minimap alignments: 1\n\nSaving to /galaxy/server/database/jobs_directory/000/175/working/miniasm_assembly/01_assembly_reads.fastq:\n  0 short-read contigs\n  1 long reads\n\nFinding overlaps with minimap... failed\nAssembling reads with miniasm... empty result\n\n\nDetermining low score threshold (2025-05-27 13:51:27)\n    Before conducting semi-global alignment of the long reads to the assembly\ngraph, Unicycler must determine a minimum alignment score threshold such that\nnonsense alignments are excluded.

Since you\nprovided both short and long reads, Unicycler will perform a hybrid assembly.\nIt will first use SPAdes to make a short-read assembly graph, and then it will\nuse various methods to scaffold that graph with the long reads.\n    For more information, please see https://github.com/rrwick/Unicycler\n\nCommand: /usr/local/bin/unicycler -t 8 -o ./ --verbosity 3 -1 fq1.fastq -2 fq2.fastq -l lr.fasta --mode normal --min_fasta_length 100 --linear_seqs 0 --min_kmer_frac 0.2 --max_kmer_frac 0.95 --kmer_count 10 --depth_filter 0.25 --start_gene_id 90.0 --start_gene_cov 95.0 --min_component_size 1000 --min_dead_end_size 1000 --scores 3,-6,-5,-2 --no_simple_bridges --keep 0\n\nUnicycler version: v0.5.1\nUsing 8 threads\n\nThe output directory already exists and files may be reused or overwritten:\n  /galaxy/server/database/jobs_directory/000/175/working\n\nBridging mode: normal\n  using default normal bridge quality cutoff: 10.00\n\nDependencies:\n  Program       Version   Status   Path                      \n  spades.py     4.0.0     good     /usr/local/bin/spades.py  \n  racon         1.5.0     good     /usr/local/bin/racon      \n  makeblastdb   2.16.0+   good     /usr/local/bin/makeblastdb\n  tblastn       2.16.0+   good     /usr/local/bin/tblastn    \n\n\nChoosing k-mer range for assembly (2025-05-27 13:49:09)\n    Unicycler chooses a k-mer range for SPAdes based on the length of the input\nreads. It uses a wide range of many k-mer sizes to maximise the chance of\nfinding an ideal assembly.\n\nSPAdes maximum k-mer: 127\nMedian read length: 251\nK-mer range: 27, 47, 63, 77, 89, 99, 107, 115, 121, 127\n\n\nSPAdes assemblies (2025-05-27 13:49:10)\n    Unicycler now uses SPAdes to assemble the short reads. It scores the\nassembly graph for each k-mer using the number of contigs (fewer is better) and\nthe number of dead ends (fewer is better). The score function is 1/(c*(d+2)),\nwhere c is the contig count and d is the dead end count.\n\nspades.py -o /galaxy/server/database/jobs_directory/000/175/working/spades_assembly -k 27 --threads 8 --gfa11 --isolate -1 /galaxy/server/database/jobs_directory/000/175/working/fq1.fastq -2 /galaxy/server/database/jobs_directory/000/175/working/fq2.fastq -m 1024\n== Warning ==  output dir is not empty!

underlying\nsequence. Single-copy contigs (those with a multiplicity of one, occurring only\nonce in the underlying sequence) are particularly useful.\n    Multiplicity determination begins by identifying contigs which are clearly\nsingle-copy because they are of low depth and do not have more than one link\nper side.\n\nMedian depth of 10 longest contigs: 1.00\n\n\nInitial single copy segments:\n    1\n\n    Unicycler now uses a greedy algorithm to propagate multiplicity through the\ngraph. For example, if two single-copy contigs merge together, the resulting\ncontig will get a multiplicity of two. When no more propagation is possible,\nadditional single-copy contigs are added and the process is repeated. This\nallows for multiplicity to be correctly assigned to the chromosome (at the\nmedian depth) but also for plasmids (which may be higher or lower in depth).\n\n          MERGING MULTIPLICITY        \n        SPLITTING MULTIPLICITY        \n       FINDING NEW SINGLE-COPY        \n          MERGING MULTIPLICITY        \n        SPLITTING MULTIPLICITY        \nREMOVING PROPAGATION TOLERANCE        \n          MERGING MULTIPLICITY        \n        SPLITTING MULTIPLICITY        \n\n\nCleaning graph (2025-05-27 13:51:27)\n    Unicycler now performs various cleaning procedures on the graph to remove\noverlaps and simplify the graph structure.

SPAdes saves the graph paths\ncorresponding to these contigs in the contigs.paths file. When one of these\npaths contains two or more anchor contigs, Unicycler can create a bridge from\nthe path.\n\nNo SPAdes contig bridges\n\n\nCreating loop unrolling bridges (2025-05-27 13:51:27)\n    When a SPAdes contig path connects an anchor contig with the middle contig\nof a simple loop, Unicycler concludes that the sequences are contiguous (i.e.\nthe loop is not a separate piece of DNA). It then uses the read depth of the\nmiddle and repeat contigs to guess the number of times to traverse the loop and\nmakes a bridge.\n\nNo loop unrolling bridges made\nnone found\n\n\nLoading reads (2025-05-27 13:51:27)\n\r0 / 1 (0.0%)\r1 / 1 (100.0%) - 5,386 bp\r1 / 1 (100.0%) - 5,386 bp\n\n\nAssembling contigs and long reads with miniasm (2025-05-27 13:51:27)\n    Unicycler uses miniasm to construct a string graph assembly using both the\nshort read contigs and the long reads. It will then use the resulting string\ngraph to produce bridges between contigs. This method requires decent coverage\nof long reads and therefore may not be fruitful if long reads are sparse.\nHowever, it does not rely on the short read assembly graph having good\nconnectivity and is able to bridge an assembly graph even when it contains many\ndead ends.\n    Unicycler uses two types of \"reads\" as assembly input: anchor contigs from\nthe short-read assembly and actual long reads which overlap two or more of\nthese contigs. It then assembles them with miniasm.\n\nAligning long reads to graph using minimap\nSaving /galaxy/server/database/jobs_directory/000/175/working/miniasm_assembly/all_segments.fasta\n1\t5386\t3\t5158\t+\t1\t5386\t227\t5382\t5155\t5155\t255\tcm:i:1149\n1\t5386\t5163\t5383\t+\t1\t5386\t1\t221\t220\t220\t255\tcm:i:47\nNumber of minimap alignments: 1\n\nSaving to /galaxy/server/database/jobs_directory/000/175/working/miniasm_assembly/01_assembly_reads.fastq:\n  0 short-read contigs\n  1 long reads\n\nFinding overlaps with minimap... failed\nAssembling reads with miniasm... empty result\n\n\nDetermining low score threshold (2025-05-27 13:51:27)\n    Before conducting semi-global alignment of the long reads to the assembly\ngraph, Unicycler must determine a minimum alignment score threshold such that\nnonsense alignments are excluded.
